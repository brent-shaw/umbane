> A Flow Programming style interface

A graphical interface that can be used to create [Flow-Based Programming (FBP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming) systems. This project aims to create library that will allow for simple FBP interfaces to be integrated into other projects.

This library makes use of [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for the graphical component, allowing it to be easily extended and adapted.

This is still under development. Help would be nice :D
